A BNF for AHA File Paths
------------------------

                </> ::=
                        <path separator. The corresponding char-
                        acter sequence is file-system--dependent.
                        The solidus (a.k.a. "slash") and reverse
                        solidus (a.k.a. "backslash") characters
                        are in common use as of 2021 A.D.>

                <terminal-node--label> ::= 0

                    ;   Thus, AHA requires that 0 is a valid
                    ;   directory name.

                <non-terminal--node---label> ::=
                        1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7

                    ;   In other words: a non-zero, octal digit.
                    ;   Thus, AHA requires that such are valid
                    ;   directory names.

                <root-label> ::=
                        <any valid directory name that is not a
                        <terminal-node--label> or a <non-terminal--
                        node---label>>
