The Design of AHA
-----------------

    Constraints
    -----------

                Design constraints for AHA include:

                    -   There should be an obvious, systematic,
                        simple way to specify the file path for
                        a new directory; it should be easy to
                        write a short program to manage this; it
                        should be easy a typical user to carry
                        out the corresponding steps manually.

                    -   File paths should be chosen from a well-
                        defined sequence.

                    -   File paths should be polite; we should
                        not have file paths like:

                                KIM/JONG-UN/IS/A/(CENSORED)

                        because that would be mean.

                    -   There should not be too many items in a
                        directory: it should not be hard for the
                        file system to list all the items in a
                        directory, nor for a human user to read
                        said list in its entirety.
