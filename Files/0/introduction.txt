Introduction

                This paper introduces AHA, an antihierarchical
                workflow for filing in hierarchical file
                systems.

                By "file system," we have in mind, for example,
                [NTFS]. In such systems, files may be (and often
                are) organized into directories (a.k.a.
                "folders"). Except for the "root directory",
                every file and directory is inside, and
                conceptually under another directory; This is
                what we mean by "hierarchical."

                We say "antihierarchical" because although many
                file systems impose or strongly encourage a
                hierarchical structure:

                    -   for a given collection, there is
                        generally no objective way to organize
                        the members of the collection into a
                        specific hierarchy ([DEWEY] and [LOC]
                        are two among many ways to organize
                        books into a hierarchy). And

                    -   some collections are inherently
                        non-hierarchical (e.g., tally marks
                        which might indicate a score in a game;
                        issues of a newspaper form a sequence).

                Therefore, AHA is a workflow which utilizes a
                hierarchical file system so as to store files in
                a conceptually non-hierarchical manner.
