    Path Length
    -----------

                AHA supports more paths than the number of
                protons in or on planet Earth.

                Path length is constrained on many file systems
                in current use. For reference, some tar file
                formats easily support path prefixes (the part
                of the path excluding the final part) of 128
                bytes. This would allow for about 64 levels of
                AHA path-infixes (each infix takes two bytes,
                one for the path separator and one for a digit),
                implying about 7 ^ 64 = 1.2 x 10 ^ 54 paths,
                about a thousand times as many as the number of
                protons found in or on planet Earth.
